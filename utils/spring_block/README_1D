The Matlab function sdof.m solves the spring-block rate-and-state model,
with aging law and radiation damping.
It was used to generate Figures A1 and A2 of

A.M. Rubin and J.-P. Ampuero (2005)
"Earthquake nucleation on (aging) rate-and-state faultsi",
J. Geophys. Res., 110, B11312, doi:10.1029/2005JB003686 :

with the following parameters: 

a = 0.01
b = 0.02 
Dc = 1e-3
V1=inf (no cut-off)
VS = 3000
Mu = 3600*VS^2
Sigma0=1e8
K = 0.2*Kc  where Kc = 2*(b-a)*Sigma0/(Mu*Dc) 
Vss = 1e-9
V0=0.5*Vss

The Matlab script sdof_figs.m sets the parameters, run the imulation
and plots figures A1 and A2 (sdof_1.eps and sdof_2.eps, respectively).
