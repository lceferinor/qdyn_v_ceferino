Some rules and advice for new developers:

DEVELOPING:
-----------

  + Do "svn update" regularly, very often
  + Do "svn update" before any "svn commit"
  + Run "devel_tools/mymakedepend.perl" if you have added a new module or a new "use" command
    (this perl script updates the list of module dependencies in the file Makefile.depend)
  + If you modified the usage of qdyn.m, document it in qdyn.m and in the manual
  + If you modified the manual, update doc/QDYN_man.pdf in the svn repository

  + Use the ToDo list file
  + Look often for comment lines in the code that contain the keyword "JPA". These are questions, issues 
    or suggestions noted by J.-P. Ampuero. They need to be addressed.
  + Learn from other developer's modifications: browse code changes online


CODE STYLE CONVENTIONS :
------------------------

  + Indentation by two spaces
  + Names of variables must be short but meaningful
  + Name of constants are capitalized
