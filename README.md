## News 

*August 2016*: In the following paper we used *QDYN* to simulate earthquake cycles and obtained events spanning a broad range of magnitudes to study earthquake scaling relations:  
  Y. Luo, J. P. Ampuero and K. Irikura  
  *Free surface effects on earthquake moment-area scaling relations*  
  Submitted to PAGEOPH, Topical Volume on *"Best Practices in Physics-based Fault Rupture Models for Seismic Hazard Assessment of Nuclear Installations"*

*QDYN* was previously hosted on [GoogleCode] (https://code.google.com/p/qdyn/) and is now on [Github] (http://ydluo.github.io/qdyn). Both [SVN] (https://subversion.apache.org) and [GIT] (https://git-scm.com) version control systems are supported. 

A *QDYN* tutorial session was offered at the [School on "Earthquakes: nucleation, triggering and relationship with aseismic processes"] (http://earthquakes.sciencesconf.org/) at Cargese, Corsica, 3 - 10 November 2014 

--------------------------------


## Summary
*QDYN* is a boundary element software package to simulate earthquake cycles (tectonic fault slip) under the quasi-dynamic approximation (quasi-static elasticity with radiation damping).  

The code implements adaptive time stepping and shared-memory parallelization to simulate earthquake cycles including seismic and aseismic slip. QDYN includes various forms of rate-and-state friction and state evolution laws. It handles non-planar fault geometries in 3D and 2D elastic media, as well as spring-block simulations. It has a user-friendly matlab interface and graphical output.

--------------------------------


## Features

  * rate-and-state friction, with velocity cut-offs, aging and slip laws
  * heterogeneous frictional properties
  * slow and fast, aseismic and seismic slip transients
  * non-planar faults (currently limited to variable dip, rectangular elements)
  * 3D, 2D and 1D (spring-block)
  * tectonic and transient loads
  * matlab wrapper and graphic output display utilities
  * parallelized for shared memory systems (OpenMP)
  * normal stress coupling
  * fully coupled with SPECFEM3D via QSB (QDYN-SPECFEM Bridge)
