QDYN is a Fortran 95 code with a Matlab wrapper
to compute quasi-dynamic earthquake cycles on faults
governed by rate-and-state friction,
embedded in a 2D or 3D elastic medium.

To get started:
	Open Matlab
	Add the qdyn directory to your path (addpath ...)
	Type 'help qdyn'
	Read the usage instructions

Examples are provided in the directory "examples".
More details are provided in the manual doc/QDYN_man.pdf. 

Note: 	The option "FINITE=1" requires a table of kernel values tabulated on a file
	(e.g. kernel_I_8192.tab) that can be generated by the matlab function 
	TabKernelFiniteFlt.m
